# ðŸš› dbtyre â€“ Helm Charts for Databases

**Think of this as a tyre truck loaded with powerful database tyres â€“ each wheel spins with a different database.**

Welcome to **dbtyre**, a curated collection of production-ready **Helm charts** for popular databases. Just like a tyre truck carries specialized wheels for different terrains, **dbtyre carries Helm charts** for diverse databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, MSSQL, and more.

## ðŸ§© Concept

Imagine a **lorry with multiple tyres**, and at the **center of each tyre is a logo** â€“ representing a different database.

Each "tyre" is:
- A modular, tested **Helm chart**.
- Plug-and-play for **Kubernetes deployments**.
- Designed to **roll smoothly** into your CI/CD workflows.
